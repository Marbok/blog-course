## Brainstorm

### Areas of knowledges

1. Java
2. Highload
3. Compilers and programming languages
4. Databases
5. Reliable software

### Areas of interests

1. Compilers
2. Games
3. Graphics
4. Physics
5. Information search
6. Information retrieval

### Unique character traits

1. Understanding of details
2. Hard working

### Topics

#### First iteration (Common and wide)

1. Create new languages: how I create new features
2. Design and implement architectures highload system: facebook, tweeter, github and etc.
3. Algorithms for searching
4. Algorithms for extractig information
5. Create games or game engine
6. Create analogs of modern frameworks
7. Create code analysis
8. Emulators: game consoles, old computers
9. Operation systems and parts
10. correctness of programs: provers and methods for correctness (binds with 7)

#### Second iteration (Filter)

1. Remove. I don't know how specialize this topic
2. This is good topic if I use subtopic
3. Framework for searching
4. Remove. Very common
5. Remove. I like more backend, but it's about highload
6. Create analog - no. Using specific framework for specific problem - yes.
7. Remove.
8. Remove. It's like potential hobby
9. Remove. Like 8
10. Good. If write about specific instruments

##### Result

1. Highload
2. Framework for problem
3. Instruments for analysis code

### Third interation (More specific)

1. Scala + Akka 
2. Erlang/Elixir (+ framework)
3. Kafka + Java
4. Scala/Java + Spark
5. Java/Scala + HDFS
6. Async and multithreding programming in Java
7. Utils and methods for analysis/testing/monitoring java code: metrics, coverage, testdata generating, frameworks for testing and etc.
8. Utils for runtime monitoring: performance, jvm monitoring and etc.
9. java + elasticsearch
10. jvm optimization

### Fourth iteration (extracting common part)

1. Highload
2. distributing system
3. actors
4. async system

## Result topic

Java + async programming (Netty, Spring WebFlux, Project Reactor, EventBase architectures)
